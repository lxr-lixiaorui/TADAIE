            <h3 style="color:gray; font-size: 18px;">> AI Rewrite</h3>
            <p id="rewr">While experts champion ordinary people's relatability in advertisements, I firmly align with Claire's perspective that celebrity endorsements create unparalleled psychological connections. The inherent fame of renowned figures allows consumers to subconsciously associate products with positive attributes of their idols, fostering lasting brand impressions that ordinary testimonials cannot match.
<br/>
This psychological phenomenon manifests clearly in consumer electronics marketing. When a prestigious film director endorses a smartphone, admirers begin perceiving the device as an extension of the artist's creativity. Though initially lacking urgent need, consumers frequently recall the celebrity's image through media exposure, gradually developing purchase impulses. This emotional transference occurred when I encountered a laptop campaign featuring my favorite director. Each cinematic masterpiece they created reinforced my mental association with the product, ultimately compelling me to upgrade my old device – not from necessity, but from cultivated desire.
<br/>
Ordinary advertisements fail to establish such potent emotional anchors. While relatable scenarios demonstrate product usage, they lack the halo effect that transforms commodities into symbolic representations. Consumers might appreciate practicality shown by common users, but rarely develop the profound psychological attachment ignited by celebrity associations.
<br/>
Through emotional transference and memory reinforcement, celebrity endorsements ultimately prove more effective. They convert products into cultural symbols intertwined with admired personalities, creating persuasive power that ordinary advertising strategies cannot replicate. (238 words)</p>

            <h3 style="color:gray; font-size: 18px;">> Your Answer</h3>
            <p id="org">Pual's opinion that people are more likely to choose the product because the ordinary people show the most common situation, is definately reasonable. However, I actually tends to Claire's perspective the use of the celebrities is more effective. As a virtue of fame of the celebrities, people are more possible to connect the famous person and the product, as a result, they will remember the good as they recalled the star person, which will contribute to an increasing deeper impression of the product and a bigger possibility to finally perchase it. 

For example, I've seen an advertisement of a fridge where my favourite director appeared in. After that, even I actually didn't have a emergence demand on buying a fridge, I would frequently think of the new fridge considering that I often recalled the popular director, which finally resulting to the growing impulse of buying the fridge because it represents my favourite celebraty, so I finally replaced my olf fridge with the new one.

To conclude, I agree Claire's opinion that the celebrity advertising is more appealing because it establishes a connection between the product and the celebrity.</p>
