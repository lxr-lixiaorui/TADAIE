            <h3 style="color:gray; font-size: 18px;">> Problem Analysis</h3>
            <p  id="probA"> - Content Relevence: 1. 未充分平衡讨论双方优点,题目要求'consider the advantages of each',但文章主要聚焦大公司优势,对小公司优点仅一笔带过
<br/>
2. 立场明确支持大公司,但缺乏对小公司潜在优势(如创新、活力)的对比分析</p>
            <p id="probB"> - Perspectives Expansion: 1. 观点展开依赖单一例子(Apple朋友),未提供更多实例或数据支撑大公司稳定性
<br/>
2. 对大公司优势如'consistent working content'的解释较浅,未详述如何转化为毕业生长期利益(如技能积累的具体方式)
<br/>
3. 词数约150,论述基本完整但深度不足,尤其在创业公司风险部分未深入</p>
            <p id="probC"> - Linguistic Expression: 1. 拼写错误:stalely→steadily
<br/>
2. 语法错误:gravely→greatly(意为显著改变)
<br/>
3. 词汇错误:nurtured→established(指成熟模式)
<br/>
4. 重复词:companies(5次),years(3次),sustainable(3次)
<br/>
5. 基础词:big→established/major
<br/>
6. 简单词:help→facilitate/assist</p>
            <p id="probD"> - Logical structure: 1. 段落过渡生硬,从大公司论述直接跳到创业公司风险,缺少连接词
<br/>
2. 结论缺失,未总结核心论点或重申立场
<br/>
3. 例子段落未明确关联回毕业生利益</p>
            <br/>

            <h3 style="color:gray; font-size: 18px;">> Improvements</h3>
            <p id="imprA"> - Content Relevence: A. 增加对小公司优点的简要提及以平衡回应(如创新环境),同时保持大公司立场
<br/>
B. 在首段添加过渡句突出对比</p>
            <p id="imprB"> - Perspectives Expansion: B. 扩展大公司优势解释,如说明'稳定模式如何培养毕业生技能'
<br/>
强化例子与主题的衔接,如指出'资源积累对职业发展的直接益处'</p>
            <p id="imprC"> - Linguistic Expression: C. 错误修正:
<br/>
1. stalely→steadily
<br/>
2. gravely→greatly
<br/>
3. nurtured→established
<br/>
4. competitivity→competitiveness
<br/>
替换建议:
<br/>
1. big→established/major
<br/>
2. help→facilitate/assist
<br/>
3. companies→corporations/organizations
<br/>
4. years→decades/periods</p>
            <p id="imprD"> - Logical structure: D. 添加连接词如'In contrast'加强段落过渡
<br/>
结尾添加总结句重申立场
<br/>
整合例子段落,确保逻辑递进</p>

            <h3 style="color:gray; font-size: 18px;">> AI Rewrite</h3>
            <p id="rewr">In my opinion, joining an established, major corporation is highly beneficial for university graduates, primarily due to its operational stability and sustainable growth. These organizations have steadily expanded over decades, developing fundamental frameworks and core competitiveness that ensure consistent income streams. Consequently, graduates working under such systems experience minimal significant changes in their roles, allowing them to accumulate essential skills and resources that enhance long-term productivity. For instance, my friend at Apple, specializing in MacOS development, noted that his responsibilities like feature updates and system debugging remained largely unchanged for years. This consistency enabled him to build expertise through professional forums and colleague networks, directly boosting his career resilience.
<br/>
In contrast, small start-ups often lack established models, leading to higher instability and abrupt shifts that may hinder a graduate's professional foundation. While start-ups offer innovation, the structured environment of large corporations ultimately provides superior security for new graduates, fostering reliable career advancement through predictable workflows and resource accessibility.

            <p id="org">In my opinion, joining an established, comparatively large company is a significant mean for those graduated students to have a more continuous and sustainable job, considering that those big enterprise has operated and enlarged stalely for many years, during this time, the leaders have explored a sustainable, fundamental running pattern and their core competitivity to have a sustainable income. Thus, for students to join those companies under those patterns, their working content will not change gravely in the next following years, their working skills and accompanying resources will ensure and help improve their productivity in the next following years. On the contrary, those start-up company may not already develop such nurtured patterns and experience, lead to potential risks or substantial changes.

For example, my friend who working at Apple, specialized in the development of MacOS, told me that the working content and approaches has been consistent for 5 years and will not change radically, including adding new features and debugging the system, thus he accumulated abundant working skills and resources such as helpful forums and websites, or professional colleagues the encountered during those years, which is useful in his long-term occupation.
