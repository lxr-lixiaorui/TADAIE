            <h3 style="color:gray; font-size: 18px;">> AI Rewrite</h3>
            <p id="rewr">I firmly support small stores' advantages, particularly their unparalleled accessibility and community-focused services. While super stores excel in product quantity, local shops provide indispensable human-centric solutions that better serve ordinary residents.
<br/>
Geographical accessibility forms the primary merit. Small stores substantially outnumber wholesale retailers, with nearly 50 neighborhood shops serving my 5,000-person hometown compared to zero super stores. This translates to one store per 100 residents, ensuring immediate access to daily necessities without lengthy commutes. Residents can simply walk to obtain groceries within minutes, unlike urban counterparts requiring transportation to distant commercial centers.
<br/>
Furthermore, small businesses deliver personalized care that chain stores cannot replicate. Owners frequently remember customers' preferences and offer tailored recommendations. When my tablet malfunctioned last semester, the local electronics shop not only repaired it within hours but also provided free maintenance tips—services unimaginable in impersonal super stores.
<br/>
Ultimately, small stores' strategic distribution and individualized attention create stronger community bonds. Their presence in every neighborhood eliminates travel burdens while fostering trust through face-to-face interactions, making them irreplaceable pillars of local life. (198 words)</p>

            <h3 style="color:gray; font-size: 18px;">> Your Answer</h3>
            <p id="org">As far as I am concerned, I am in favor of Andrew's opinion, which these small stores provides more convenience for ordinary people, considering that the assessibility of small store are far more considerable than those wholesale stores. That is, the numbers of small markets are obviously greater, each community almost has one, which can benefit more people, caters more people's demand. However, the wholesale stores are common located at places with a great population density such as downtown because a wholesale store provides much more quantity of commdites, which forces the manager to ensure there's suffifient demand, while this may finally contributes to the neglection of some people who don't live in these place, such as in countryside. For example, in my hometown, which is a small town, with only 5000 people, there's even not one wholesale, however, there's nearly 50 small stores. It is this stores that really faciliate people's life. In conclusion, the small markets always brings more benenit to ordinary residents.</p>
