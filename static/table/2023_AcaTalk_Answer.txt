1:It is true that we cannot go so far as to dismiss the view held by student B as down-right absurd, but personally speaking, I am of student A’s overall position. Obviously, searching information online can contribute to comprehensive understanding in commodities. When you search for information on the Internet, the resources at your disposal are virtually unlimited. Take the example of eBay. From product details and reviews to comparisons, forums, and expert opinions, the platform offers a wealth of different sources with a wide range of perspectives. This diverse collection of information ensures an exhaustive understanding of the product, and even its potential alternatives. As a matter of fact, if we tend to our friends or families, lost would be the exceptional opportunity to broaden our understanding in products and enrich our experience in shopping. Of course, in extreme cases, where there is little or no well-developed communication systems, so as to preclude any possibility to be connected to the Internet, friends and families become the only choice. However, in general, it is no wonder that resources posted online has higher priority than advice from friends and families in making a purchase.
2:It is true that we cannot go so far as to dismiss views held by Andrew and Claire as down-right absurd, but personally speaking, other tactics also hold merits in this topic. In the past decades, with the robust growth of economy, governments have been eager to invest countless resources into infrastructure to an extreme extent that they have ignored the gradual decline in demand for this area. It follows that the soaring rate of deserted amenities, such as spacious shopping center, ambitious projects on resource development and so on, epitomizes investment collapse, which in turn aggravates the poor financial performance of these governments. Accordingly, checking the radical expenditure squandered on public construction can contribute to compensating the limited budget. Of course, in some cases, where countries hover on the brink of offering quality of life services, interference in development of shared facilities might rule out the possibility to improve living standards. However, in general, it is no wonder that the upside of provident management of infrastructure projects outcompetes its downside.
3:While we cannot go so far as to dismiss Andrew and Claire's views as downright absurd, I personally believe that other fields of study have merit in this area. In my opinion, adults should prioritize the development of digital literacy skills to better adapt to today's technologically advanced world. Digital literacy, which refers to the ability to navigate, evaluate, and effectively use digital tools, platforms, and information, ensures a promising outlook in the modern workplace. Regardless of industry or role, computers, the Internet, and digital tools are ubiquitous. From using productivity software to communicating via email and collaborating online, employees are expected to have a basic or even advanced level of digital literacy. By developing digital skills, people can increase their efficiency, productivity and adaptability in the workplace. In conclusion, it is not surprising that digital literacy is a higher priority than the two skills mentioned above.
4:It is true that we cannot go so far as to dismiss views held by Andrew as down-right absurd, but personally speaking, I am of Claire’s overall position. Obviously, in today's competitive job market, acquiring an advanced degree can significantly increase career opportunities. It can open doors to higher-level positions, promotions, and even career shifts. Employers often value individuals who possess both relevant work experience and advanced education, as they bring a unique blend of practical expertise and academic perspectives to the table. Additionally, an advanced degree can provide specialized knowledge, helping individuals stay updated in their industry and adapt to ever-evolving job requirements, leading to a promising prospect for a wider range of career pathways. Of course, we should not be negligent or even indifferent to the intense tension brought about by juggling between two challenging tasks. However, in general, it is no wonder that the upside of working at a full-time job and chasing further study outcompetes its downside.
5:While I appreciate Andrew’s opinion that implementing additional taxes would encourage passengers to consider more environmentally friendly ways of transportation, I have to respectfully disagree with him. That’s because looking at it from another perspective, we may notice that this method has limited effectiveness. Imposing extra taxes would bring about social fairness issues to some degree. To begin with, people with lower incomes are unwilling to pay for the higher plane tickets. To reduce the cost of transportation, they are likely to choose other ways such as private cars. There is no doubt that cars can cause severe air pollution because of carbon emissions, which worsens the environmental situation that governments intend to improve. Therefore, traveling by airplane is about to become the exclusive way for higher-income people who give little attention to the additional environmental taxes. Based on the reasons above, we can conclude that implementing additional taxes is unreasonable and impractical.
6:In my mind, it is not advisable for governments to impose penalties on those companies.\n While it is crucial to address environmental concerns, imposing penalties on companies that provide important products and services can hurt the economy, further reducing the revenue that could have been spent on sustainable practices. For instance, consider the automotive industry. Car manufacturers provide essential transportation options for individuals and businesses, contributing significantly to economic activity. If those manufacturers were to pay heavy penalties, like 30 percent more, they will figure out ways to cut spending in order to balance the budget. As we can imagine, it could lead to job losses, reduced investment, and a decline in overall economic output. In this case, governments will experience a decline in tax revenue, and therefore lack sufficient funding to invest in exploring greener energy like hydrogen or solar power. In conclusion, while it is essential to address environmental concerns, imposing penalties on companies that provide important products and services can have adverse effects on the economy.
7:I believe that the most important and compulsory course in high school should be a language course. Learning a new language not only enhances cognitive abilities but also opens up a world of opportunities for social interaction. Language courses, especially foreign languages, provide students with the ability to communicate with a broader range of people from diverse backgrounds. For instance, when I enrolled in a Spanish language course, I met students from various Spanish-speaking countries. Learning their language not only improved my communication skills but also allowed me to forge friendships with people I wouldn't have connected with otherwise. Furthermore, language courses promote cultural understanding and tolerance. When students learn a new language, they gain insights into the customs, traditions, and values of the speakers of that language. This understanding fosters empathy and helps students connect with individuals from different cultural backgrounds. In conclusion, a language course should be made compulsory in high school because it enables students to make more friends from diverse backgrounds, enhances their communication skills, and promotes cultural understanding. These skills and experiences will undoubtedly shape a more open-minded and socially adept generation of individuals.
8:It is true that we cannot go so far as to dismiss the view held by Claire Andrew as down-right absurd, but personally speaking, I am of Claire’s overall position. Obviously, services provided in a super store can contribute to a better shopping experience. Through offering extended operating hours, spacious parking lots, and user-friendly layouts, super stores are designed to provide convenience to shoppers, which can be further enhanced by online shopping and home delivery services furnished by retailing giants for busy city dwellers. Take the example of the shopping app developed by Metro. It enables customers to easily locate products intended to buy through several simple steps, then with a few clicks, the order is placed and what they have to do next is to wait for it to be delivered at their home. Of course, in some cases, where some individuals gravitate to specialty items to meet their distinct tastes, small stores might be a better option. However, in general, it is no wonder that shopping in a super store has higher priority than in a small store.
9:I could not agree more with Paul when he said that art is an essential part of a culture and has a significant impact on society, which makes it obvious that it should be supported more financially. Take the art of kite making in China as an example. It is a traditional Chinese folk art that has created many joyful and unforgettable memories for Chinese children, including my parents and grandparents' generation, since ancient times. However, during the turbulent years after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, kite flying lost its popular appeal. Unfortunately, many of the designs, drawings, patterns, and records of kites did not survive the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), and very few descendants of traditional kite makers inherited the art of kite making. What's worse, the past generations of kite makers could not rely on their craft alone to make a living in today's competitive society. The saving grace was a news item about 4 young university students from Peking University who held a fundraiser for a kite shop owner in Beijing. This news attracted great attention from universities, local communities, entrepreneurs, and even the Chinese government. More than enough money was donated to support local kite shop owners and workshops to train potential kite makers. It was the financial help of the society that helped to preserve this precious, traditional, valuable form of Chinese art. In conclusion, there is no doubt that governments should provide more financial support to artists.
10:It is true that we cannot go so far as to dismiss views held by Paul and Kelly as down-right absurd, but personally speaking, other aspects also hold merits in this topic. Obviously, regular exercise can contribute to achieving long-term wellness. In contemporary society, as is generally believed, a great number of people, office workers or students working around the clock and deprived of time to exercise, are burdened, or even crushed by their overwhelming workload. If they are granted with the opportunity, they deserved to release the pressure through exercise, things will be totally different. For example, engaging in moderate intensity aerobic activities, such as jogging, swimming, or cycling at least 30 minutes per day, can definitely maintain or improve our cardiovascular health, which is critical to overall fitness. Of course, in some cases, where the exercise load goes far beyond the limit, side effects or even injuries would occur. However, in general, it is no wonder that the upside of frequent physical activities outcompetes its downside in keeping in good health.
11:I’m on board with Kelly’s idea that governments should consider funding recreational facilities since residents prefer to participate in outdoor activities rather than appreciate art in a museum or a gallery. Besides that, I hold the notion that governments that give priority to investing in recreational facilities can effectively promote the overall well-being of the community. The main reason is that when city dwellers are provided access to recreational spaces, they will have the precious chance to engage in a range of outdoor physical activities, which means that the risk of various health issues caused by sedentary habits can be reduced. For instance, my grandparents had an unforgettable experience of having accessible recreational facilities funded by the local government. To be more specific, they engaged in a variety of activities, including jogging and playing badminton, in a newly constructed park every morning, contributing to the fact that they were rarely bothered by chronic diseases, like arthritis. By contrast, if governments spend a modest outlay on recreational facilities, the overall fitness of residents will not be enhanced significantly, owing to the fact that people have limited opportunities to take part in outdoor activities. Therefore, I think that governments should prioritize funding recreational activities since it can have a positive effect on residents’ life expectancy.
12:Contrary to Kelly's statement that it is unwise for governments to fund space exploration, I believe that government-funded space programs have a positive effect on society because they can stimulate job creation. The primary reason is that when governments invest in space exploration, in addition to a wide range of skilled professionals, a very large workforce is required in related sectors such as aerospace manufacturing and logistics, meaning that government funding enables the recruitment and employment of individuals in the space industry. For example, my country has undergone a dramatic transformation because the government subsidized a space program. Specifically, the space mission drove demand for various support services, including transportation and infrastructure development, and helped turn many workers who had lost their jobs due to the permanent closure of factories into truck drivers and construction workers. On the other hand, if governments choose not to financially support space exploration, residents will have limited job opportunities in space-related businesses because the industry may stagnate without government funding. Therefore, I believe that government funding for space exploration is important because it leads to the creation of job opportunities.
13:Regarding the question posed by the professor, Paul has some merit in mentioning that a better environment can have an impact on student learning. However, the evidence he offers to justify his position-competitive salaries-is questionable. If teachers are already adequately compensated, why does teacher turnover remain high? In most cases, raising salaries will not only reduce the rate, but also attract more talented people to the teaching profession. In addition to solving the problem of teacher shortages, higher salaries can also serve as an incentive to motivate performance and commitment. With enthusiasm, teachers will constantly improve their teaching skills and focus more on student feedback, benefiting students, schools, and the education system as a whole. Of course, in some cases, if teachers' salaries are raised inappropriately, counterproductive effects such as a passive attitude toward teaching or even corruption in the education system would occur. In general, however, it is not surprising that the positive effects of allocating more resources to teacher salaries outweigh the negative effects.
14:It is true that we cannot go so far as to dismiss the view held by Andrew as down-right absurd, but personally speaking, I am of Kelly’s overall position. Obviously, competition from online shopping can contribute to a positive development in local stores. Through offering spacious parking lots, and user-friendly layouts, local stores are stimulated to provide convenience and better shopping experience to shoppers, which can be further enhanced by integrating online shopping patterns and home delivery services furnished by retailing giants. Take the example of the shopping app developed by Metro. Not only can it enable busy city dwellers to easily get products intended to buy through several clicks and the reliable delivery service, but also satisfy the special need to go window shopping given the one-step shopping it provides. Of course, in some cases, where some individuals’ lives are sunk deep into the cyberspace, shopping online might be the only option for them. However, in general, it is no wonder that shopping in local stores has higher priority than shopping online.
15:I agree agree with Paul that schools are obligated to alter the time schedule to later time, due to the sufficient time for students to take breakfast and avoid traffic congestion. Apparently, some of the students staying up late for homework or academic assignments undoubtedly would run into hustle and bustle in the morning, and consequently, having extra 1 hour time would allow them to easily take the breakfast to maintain energetic and healthy eating style. Furthermore, the rush hours in the morning never provides privilege for students, meaning it would be quite convenient for them to take all sorts of transportation to arrive school punctually. For instance, those living quite far away from schools would be free to choose to take private cars or subway without any doubts of being late due to the traffic jam caused by the routine workload. Thus, based on the two benefits brought by the new schedule, schools are obliged to alter the original one.
16:The influence of watching video on children's growth is a topic that has garnered significant attention and debate in recent years. While there are differing opinions on the matter, as proposed by Kelly and Andrew, it is crucial to consider both the potential drawbacks and benefits. Excessive video consumption can indeed have adverse effects on a child's development. Extended screen time may lead to sedentary behavior, resulting in decreased physical activity and potential health issues like obesity. Additionally, excessive exposure to certain types of videos, such as violent or inappropriate content, can have a negative impact on a child's emotional well-being, behavior, and social skills. However, it is worth noting that not all videos have a detrimental influence. Educational and age-appropriate content can actually enhance a child's growth and learning. Educational videos can promote cognitive development, improve language skills, and introduce new concepts. Moreover, certain programs and videos designed specifically for toddlers and preschoolers can help them develop social, emotional, and problem-solving skills. Ultimately, it is important to encourage a well-rounded upbringing involving real-world experiences, outdoor activities, social interactions, and diverse learning opportunities. Parents and caregivers need to strike a balance between screen time and other activities in a child's life through providing guidance and monitoring the type and duration of video consumption.
17:Differentiated from what Kelly has mentioned that the automation resulting from rapid technological developments may replace a wide range of traditional jobs, from my perspective, the fast pace of scientific and technological progress creates more job opportunities instead of leading to high unemployment. Obviously, the main reason is that if a society experiences a fast advancement in science and technology, a large number of ventures which are inspired by the rapid progress will require a diverse range of roles, including designing and marketing, which means that many skilled professionals can seize the opportunity to find a job in related fields. For instance, my hometown has undergone a dramatic transformation because of the rapid pace of technological progress; to be more specific, the government invested billions of dollars in plenty of technological programs during the last decade, so a lot of new industries and businesses which created a demand for robotic technicians and AI specialists emerged, contributing to the fact that college graduates whose majors were technology-related were provided with tons of well-paid jobs. By contrast, if the development of science and technology is not as rapid as it is now, there will be limited job chances offered to the public, owing to the fact that ventures that rely on innovation-driven growth will not thrive and generate more job opportunities. Therefore, I think that the fast-paced nature of scientific and technological developments brings more benefits to the society since it helps foster job creation.
18:From my perspective, the strategy of asking ordinary people to promote products is much preferable compared to hiring celebrities. The main reason, of course, is that hiring ordinary people can be much more budget-friendly. Claire‘s point makes sense that using celebrities in advertising can be more effective in getting people‘s attention. However, she overlooks the exorbitant price differences between when companies work with celebrities and when they work with ordinary individuals. When companies choose ordinary people to advertise their products, these people may be willing to collaborate at a lower cost or even for free in exchange for the product or other perks, meaning that the company can save considerable money which can be redirected to other areas, such as marketing and product development. For instance, a new company that wanted to promote its athletic apparel underwent a significant transformation because it adopted the strategy of hiring ordinary people to promote its products. This strategy, which involved giving away free athletic apparel and discounts to people who were active and enthusiastic about fitness, helped to significantly reduce the financial investment while still effectively promoting the products. On the other hand, if the company insisted on hiring celebrities for endorsements, advertising would have accounted for a large portion of the financial outlay due to the fact that they had to pay high fees to celebrities. Therefore, I hold the notion that choosing ordinary people instead of celebrities is better because companies can effectively keep costs down.
19:With valid arguments on both sides, complex is the question of whether governments should increase taxes on car fuel to reduce air pollution. On one hand, raising taxes on car fuel can potentially incentivize individuals to use alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit or cycling, thereby reducing air pollution. Higher fuel prices may also encourage drivers to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles, leading to a decrease in emissions. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of this approach. Increasing fuel taxes disproportionately impacts low-income individuals who may heavily rely on their cars for commuting or other essential purposes. This could create financial burden and limited mobility options for those who cannot afford more efficient or alternative transportation methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of increasing fuel taxes in reducing air pollution is not guaranteed. Governments should also focus on investing in infrastructure for electric vehicles and supporting research and development of cleaner fuels. In conclusion, while increasing taxes on car fuel may appear to be a potential solution to reduce air pollution, it is essential for governments to consider the socioeconomic impact and explore a comprehensive approach that encompasses various strategies to achieve meaningful and lasting results.
20:Differentiated from what Claire has mentioned that digital payments may lead to overspending, from my perspective, the rise of online payments is a positive development since it can help people have greater control of their money. Obviously, the primary reason is that when people make online payments, their transactions are often processed instantly or within a short period of time, meaning that people can see the impact on the account balance immediately, which helps staying aware of their spending habits. For instance, my cousin had an unforgettable experience of utilizing online payment methods instead of using cash; to be more specific, he used an application which helped him analyze his expenses and made informed financial decisions every month, leading to the fact that he had a clear overview of his financial activities and then allocated money more effectively. By contrast, if people have a preference for cash usage, it can be challenging for them to keep track of their spending, due to the fact that physical cash doesn’t leave a digital trail like online payments do, making it harder to monitor and analyze their expenses. Therefore, I hold the notion that the trend towards digital payments is positive as they can greatly contribute to building a better sense of spending and promote smarter financial management.
21:Besides the views proposed by Kelly and Andrew, personally speaking, another advantage of being an early adopter is the opportunity to stay ahead of the curve and leverage new technology or trends for personal or professional gains. Early adopters often have the advantage of being the first to explore and understand new innovations, giving them a competitive edge. For example, early adopters of social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter were able to build large followings and establish themselves as influencers or thought leaders before the market became saturated. Being an early adopter can also provide a sense of fulfillment and curiosity. If you enjoy exploring new ideas, technologies, or trends, being an early adopter allows you to indulge in your passions and stay abreast of the latest advancements. It can be exciting to be on the cutting edge and have access to features or functionalities before they become mainstream. However, there are also disadvantages to being an early adopter. Early adopters may face compatibility issues or bugs that have not yet been ironed out. New technologies may not be fully optimized or compatible with existing systems or devices, leading to frustration or inefficiencies. Additionally, early adopters often bear the risk of unforeseen problems or shortcomings in the product, which may necessitate repairs or replacements. In summary, being an early adopter can offer advantages such as staying ahead in the market and fulfilling curiosity, but it can also come with drawbacks such as potential compatibility issues or bugs.
22:It is true that Kelly’s concern is reasonable to some extent, but outdoor classes once a month can be highly beneficial for students in this age group for several reasons. Firstly, outdoor classes provide a change of environment from the usual indoor setting, allowing students to experience learning in a different and refreshing way. Being outdoors can spark curiosity and engage students in a more active and immersive learning experience. This can result in increased motivation, attentiveness, and enthusiasm for learning. Secondly, outdoor classes offer numerous opportunities for hands-on and experiential learning. Students can engage with nature, observe scientific phenomena, and develop a deeper understanding of various subjects such as biology, ecology, or geography. These experiences provide practical applications that enhance learning and retention of knowledge. Moreover, outdoor classes support the physical and mental well-being of students. Outdoor activities encourage physical exercise, which is crucial for maintaining good health. Exposure to natural surroundings can have a calming effect, reducing stress and boosting mental well-being. In conclusion, incorporating outdoor classes once a month can be highly beneficial for students in this age group.
23:I’m on board with Kelly’s idea that governments should consider funding recreational facilities since residents prefer to participate in outdoor activities rather than appreciate art in a museum or a gallery. Besides that, I hold the notion that governments that give priority to invest in recreational facilities can effectively promote the overall well-being of the community. Obviously, the main reason is that when city dwellers are provided access to recreational spaces, they will have the precious chance to engage in a range of outdoor physical activities, which means that the risk of various health issues caused by sedentary habits can be reduced. For instance, my grandparents had an unforgettable experience of having accessible recreational facilities funded by the local government; to be more specific, they engaged in a variety of activities, including jogging and playing badminton, in a newly constructed park every morning, contributing to the fact that they were rarely bothered by chronic diseases, like arthritis. By contrast, if governments spend a modest outlay on recreational facilities, the overall fitness of residents will not be enhanced significantly, owing to the fact that people have limited opportunities to take part in outdoor activities, so they are more prone to a sedentary lifestyle, which can increase the risk of health problems such as obesity and diabetes. Therefore, I think that governments should prioritize funding recreational activities since it can have a positive effect on residents’ life expectancy.
24:The debate between certification-based learning programs and traditional degree programs is complex, and both have their advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, certification-based learning programs offer a focused and efficient way to gain specific skills and knowledge. They often involve hands-on training and are designed to provide practical experience in a shorter period of time. On the other hand, traditional degree programs offer a more comprehensive and well-rounded education. They provide in-depth knowledge in a specific field and often include general education courses that help develop critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills. A degree program also carries more weight and recognition in traditional corporate environments where certain positions may require a specific degree. In conclusion, there is no definitive answer as to whether certification-based learning programs are better than the traditional way to pursue a degree. It ultimately comes down to individual circumstances and goals. Each approach offers unique benefits, and one's choice should be based on what aligns with their specific needs and aspirations. It's important to note that the two approaches can also complement each other. A degree holder can enhance their skills and employability by obtaining relevant certifications in their field, while someone with certifications may consider pursuing a degree to broaden their knowledge and career opportunities.
25:In my opinion, a well-rounded curriculum should include both foundational knowledge in core subjects and classes that foster creativity, such as art and music. \n Acquiring foundational knowledge lays the groundwork for a strong educational foundation. Proficiency in core subjects not only helps students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, but also prepares them for future academic and career pursuits. Math, reading, science, and history provide students with essential tools for understanding the world around them and engaging in informed discussions.\n However, creativity should not be neglected in the curriculum. Art and music classes play a crucial role in developing a child's imaginative and expressive abilities. These subjects offer students a different mode of learning, helping them think outside the box and approach problems from a different perspective. Art and music also enable students to explore and embrace their individuality, fostering self-expression and boosting their confidence.\n Moreover, incorporating art and music into the curriculum enriches the overall educational experience. It encourages interdisciplinary connections, as creative thinking often intersects with other subjects. For instance, visual arts can enhance understanding of history and culture, while music can complement literature and language. Beyond academic benefits, exposure to art and music promotes emotional well-being and can serve as a form of therapy or stress relief for students.
26:Differentiated from what Kelly has mentioned that it is unwise for governments to fund space exploration, from my perspective, government-funded space programs have a positive effect on the society since they can foster job creation. Evidently, the primary reason is that when governments invest in space exploration, in addition to a wide range of skilled professionals, a very large workforce within related sectors such as aerospace manufacturing and logistics will be required, meaning that government funding enables the recruitment and employment of individuals in the space industry. For instance, my country has undergone a dramatic transformation because of the government subsidizing a space program; to be more specific, the space mission drove demand for various support services including transportation and infrastructure development, contributing to the fact that a large number of workers who had lost their jobs as a result of the permanent shutdown of factories became truck drivers and builders. By contrast, if governments choose not to financially support space exploration, residents will have limited job opportunities within space-related ventures, owing to the fact that the industry may experience stagnation without government funding. Therefore, I think that governments funding for space exploration is significant as it leads to the creation of job chances.
27:I'm on board with Paul’s idea that it is essential for scientists to share all scientific discoveries freely since it helps scientists who publish their findings achieve recognition. Besides that, free sharing of scientific discoveries can make a contribution to accelerated scientific progress. Obviously, the primary reason is that when research is freely available, a growing number of scientists can access and utilize the information, which enables them to build on previous findings and explore new areas of study. For instance, the whole world has undergone a total transformation because of the open access to scientific discoveries; to be more specific, scientists around the world worked collaboratively by sharing data and insights about the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the unprecedentedly rapid development of effective vaccines. By contrast, if there is restricted access to scientific discoveries, research progress can be slowed down as scientists might end up duplicating efforts unknowingly or they might miss out on vital information that could aid their own research. Therefore, I hold the notion that sharing scientific discoveries is essential since it can accelerate the development of science.
28:In my opinion, some people decide to live in rural areas instead of urban areas for two main reasons: having strong ties to their rural communities and being less financially pressured. First, since many people come from rural villages, they have already formed many deep-rooted relationships there. Thus, it is hard to leave all of these behind and go to an unfamiliar big city to live. For instance, when my friend George was in his twenties, he decided to stay in his hometown, a small village in Idaho, despite being offered a job in New York City. He is now in his thirties, but he never regrets this decision. He says that this is because living in rural areas allows him to be closer to his best friend and family members. He wants to hang out with his best friend whom he has known for more than eight years when he is off work and provides help for his parents and siblings when needed.\n Another reason for people to enjoy rural living is that it is cheaper to live in rural areas compared to urban centers. This includes almost every aspect of life such as food, clothing, and housing. Take George's example again, choosing to live in an apartment near his workplace in an urban area means that he has to pay a strikingly high rent that leaves him little to do anything else. Therefore, living in rural areas can help lighten such economic burdens.
29:Nowadays, with the unprecedented-development of science and technology, more and more people are considering making purchase decisions depending on information from online sources.  I would subscribe to Kelly and Andrew’s opinion that making purchasing decisions relying on our friends would be more reliable. It is widely acknowledged that Internet is so easily accessible that everyone can post a video, message or remark online, which means that those information may be false or exaggerated. In this case, we can not acquire accurate information telling us whether those product are high-quality, suitable or not. However, our friends can go straight to the heart of the matter pointing out the fault or advantage of those products. Take myself as an example. I used to want to buy an electric car like Tesla because online information indicated that the ranges of them were optimistic. However, when i told my friend my thought, he retorted that from his first-hand experience, most electric cars on sale today cannot yet challenge the gasoline cars and the maximum endurance were not as described on the internet. As a result, i bought a gasoline car instead of an electric car saving me a lot of trouble and other people who bought an electric car are always complaining about the short battery life.
30:Early adopters often have a competitive edge. They are able to utilize the latest technology, features, or processes before anyone else, which can potentially lead to increased efficiency, productivity, or user experience. In some cases, they might also be able to influence the product’s development by providing feedback, thus shaping the product to better fit their needs.One classic example of the advantage of being an early adopter is the companies that were quick to integrate cloud technology into their operations. Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched in 2006, and companies that adopted this technology early were able to drastically reduce their IT costs by not having to invest in and maintain their own servers. This also allowed them to scale their businesses more quickly and efficiently, as they could leverage AWS’s infrastructure rather than having to build their own. In addition, these early adopters had the chance to influence the development of AWS by providing feedback and requesting new features, helping to shape the service into a tool that was even more useful for their specific needs. This gave them a significant competitive advantage over companies that were slower to adopt cloud technology.
31:I personally agree with Claire, who points out that introducing an environmental tax or higher fine to penalize companies for environmental damage is not a wise choice. This is mainly because this approach may have a negative impact on consumers. If imposed a certain amount of fines for less green practices, it is more likely for companies to transfer extra costs to consumers, thus triggering the increasing price of commodities and services. The cost of such important products and services, such as power, water, and public transportation, is normally a mandatory component of household expenses. As a result, families, especially those in financial difficulty, will have a hard time balancing their family expenses. There could be various ways to encourage companies to improve their environmental practices and reduce further damage, but no matter what measure the government would take, protecting citizens’ living standards from declining is the first and top priority.
32:Differentiated from what Claire has mentioned that many social media users stick to their own views while ignoring others, from my perspective, social media makes a great contribution to increasing similarities between people from different nations. Obviously, the primary reason is that when people around the world use social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, to instantly communicate and share information across borders, they are usually exposed to a variety of cultures and lifestyles, which means that they can easily understand and then accept the differences. For instance, my country has undergone a total transformation because of the advancement in social media; to be more specific, in recent years, a growing number of teenagers in my country has learned about western cultures through a social media platform called Weibo, leading to the fact that cultural barriers between the East and the West has been significantly reduced. Therefore, since social media plays an essential role in narrowing the cultural gap between different countries, I hold the notion that differences between people worldwide are diminishing.
33:In my opinion, excessive consumption has become a serious problem in today's society and there are several reasons to support this viewpoint. Firstly, excessive consumption contributes to a range of negative environmental impacts. When we buy more than we need, it leads to an increase in the production of goods, which often requires the extraction of natural resources and energy consumption. This results in deforestation, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the depletion of natural habitats. Additionally, the disposal of unused or quickly discarded items contributes to the growing problem of waste management. Secondly, excessive consumption creates a culture of materialism and fosters a never-ending cycle of desire for new things. Advertising and societal pressures often encourage us to constantly upgrade and replace our belongings, leading to unnecessary accumulation of goods and a dissatisfaction with what we already have. This mindset can lead to personal financial struggles, as people may spend beyond their means to keep up with this consumerist culture.\n In conclusion, excessive consumption has indeed become a serious problem due to its negative impact on the environment, its reinforcement of materialistic values, and its potential for contributing to social injustices. 
34:While it is true that close relationships can provide emotional support and a sense of being understood, from my perspective, spending time with a larger group of friends makes a greater contribution to a person’s health since larger groups often participate in a variety of physical activities. Obviously, the primary reason is that when socializing with a crowd, people prefer to engage in activities like sports, hiking or dancing that require physical effort, which can help individuals maintain a healthy weight, improve cardiovascular health, and boost overall fitness levels. For example, my friend Alex had an unforgettable experience of promoting his physical health; to be more specific, after he joined a larger group of friends who are health-conscious last year instead of spending his free time playing video games at home, he often played football with the group and went on hiking trips on weekends, leading to the fact that he was hardly bothered by obesity and other physical ailments. In conclusion, I hold the notion that engaging with a large gathering can help amplify a person’s physical well-being since there are plenty of physical activities to get involved in.
35:I am align with Kelly’s opinion that creating to-do lists is helpful for both work and studies. This is because to-do lists serve as a useful tool in managing schedules and increasing the productivity. Take myself as an example, during the period of final exam preparation, I can effectively allocate time to review each subject with the help of a to-do list. To be more specific, I allocate my mornings to memorize English vocabulary words as I tend to be more energetic during that time. In the afternoons, I find it suitable to collaborate with team members on math problems, especially when everyone is alert after enjoying a cup of coffee. Obviously, utilizing to-do lists is an effective way to maintain order and structure in one’s tasks. Although Andrew’s point may sound convincing by highlighting that unpredictable experiences would bring people some valuable insights, this is not always the case in reality. The truth is unforeseen events may lead to more serious situations, such as time and financial constraints or even putting individuals in jeopardy. Consequently, having to-do lists proves necessary and advantageous for people. 
36:I’m on board with Claire’s idea that imposing environmental taxes on air travel will make a minimal impact on the issue of air pollution. Besides that, I suppose that such a tax could have negative effects on tourism that depends heavily on air travel. Obviously, the primary reason is that if the environmental tax is implemented, the price of airline tickets might be extremely high, which could deter tourists, particularly budget travelers, from visiting certain destinations, especially those that are only accessible by air. For instance, the tourism industry in my hometown has experienced negative consequences due to the implementation of a green tax on flights; to be more specific, the cost of flights to my hometown, which is a small island that is only approachable by air, is three times higher than before, leading to the fact that fewer tourists choose to visit the island, which then has a ripple effect on the island’s economy that relies greatly on tourism. Therefore, I hold the notion that it is unreasonable for the government to levy eco-taxes on air travel since such taxes may have detrimental impacts on tourism.
37:[cause and effect + providing details/examples] To my mind, having a pet can provide numerous benefits to children in their development. One of them is that pets can act as constant companions, providing unconditional love and support. To further illustrate, pets such as dogs and cats can be a source of unwavering emotional support, offering a listening ear and a non-judgmental presence. In this way, children may find it much easier to develop strong bonds with their pets, which can help them feel loved, accepted, and emotionally secure. This companionship can be especially valuable for children who feel lonely or struggle with social interactions. For example, a child with a pet may feel more at ease when dealing with a challenging situation, such as starting a new school. In conclusion, pets can provide a sense of comfort and togetherness to children."[comparison and contrast]\n To my mind, having a pet can provide numerous benefits to children in their development. One of them is that having pets, especially dogs, can encourage children to take more physical exercises. To further illustrate, playing fetch, going for walks, or participating in agility training with their pets can serve as fun ways to keep children active and promote a healthy lifestyle. Over time, these activities can contribute to children's development of motor skills, coordination, and overall physical fitness. On the contrary, without a pet, children may spend their spare time sitting in front of the television or playing video games. This sedentary lifestyle deprives them of the benefits of physical activities and exposure to fresh air, sunlight and nature, potentially causing health problems such as obesity, fatigue, eye strain, reduced immune function, and so on. Therefore, having a pet can offer unique and significant benefits to children's overall physical well-being."
38:While it is true that books enable readers to acquire in-depth knowledge, from my perspective, on shaping people’s perspectives and opinions, television produces a stronger effect since it usually establishes an emotional connection with viewers. Evidently, when audiences tune into TV, they will be exposed to dramatized events, personal stories and emotional music, which means that their opinions will be influenced easily by strong emotional responses evoked by TV. For instance, an event occurring in my hometown could prove the statement mentioned above; to be more specific, a celebrity spoke openly about his struggles with mental health in a television series, which significantly shifted public opinion and reduced the stigma associated with mental health issues. On the other hand, books are typically a more solitary experience and reactions to events are delayed until the reader reaches certain points in the text, making it unlikely to evoke an emotional response and influence opinions. Therefore, I hold the notion that compared to books, television is a more powerful tool for shaping perspectives.
39:In the quest for environmental prosperity, there exist a myriad of measures individuals can undertake beyond the realm of waste management to yield substantial positive impacts on our fragile ecosystem. Altering our commuting habits, from my unwavering perspective, affords a crucial avenue for positive change. By embracing sustainable modes of transportation, such as cycling, walking, or utilizing public transit systems, individuals can tangibly reduce carbon emissions and alleviate traffic congestion. Amsterdam, renowned for its extensive cycling infrastructure, serves as a remarkable exemplar of this concept. With approximately 60% of its population commuting via bicycles, the city has significantly curtailed greenhouse gas emissions, mitigated air pollution, and fostered a vibrant urban atmosphere conducive to physical and mental well-being. Furthermore, adopting telecommuting or remote work practices can be highly effective in reducing commuting-related environmental impacts. With constant advancements in technology, many jobs can now be done from the comfort of our homes. This not only saves time and money but also reduces the carbon emissions associated with daily commuting.
40:I’m on board with Claire’s perspective that donating money to international charities instead of local ones is more meaningful since worldwide groups have the scale and resources to address issues like global warming and poverty. Besides that, I hold the notion that international charities are more capable of dealing with urgent situations than local ones. The primary reason is that in the wake of a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis, international charities often mobilize quickly to provide immediate relief, such as food, clean water, shelter, and medical aid, which means that donating to these charities during these times can help ensure that immediate needs are met. For instance, following the universal COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many people around the world donated money to global aid agencies like the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders, immediately supporting global efforts to combat the virus and provide aid to the most affected communities. However, local charities often lack the capacity to reach communities across the world instantly, making them an ineffective choice for responding to urgent global crises. Therefore, I reckon that people should donate money to international charitable groups when an urgent situation occurs because they often have extensive experience in emergency response.
41:There is an ongoing debate regarding whether drivers should be obliged to pay a fee in order to drive their cars during peak hours. While the prospect of imposing such charges may initially stir mixed reactions, I firmly believe that implementing such a policy can relieve traffic congestion and subsequently enhance overall transportation efficiency. One key benefit of levying fees on motorists during the busiest time of the day is the potential to deter unnecessary journeys. By imposing a financial burden, individuals will naturally reconsider the urgency and necessity of their trips. An abundance of studies conducted by authoritative institutes highlight that charging additional fees contributes to improved traffic flow, reduced travel times, and increased use of sustainable transportation. To illustrate, let us consider the bustling city of Los Angeles, notorious for its traffic woes. With a fee system in place, drivers intending to embark on non-essential trips during peak hours may opt for alternatives, such as carpooling, public transportation, or even cycling. Consequently, the roads would be less congested, leading to shorter travel times for those genuinely needing to commute during peak periods.
42:Although it is true that giving more financial support to farmers and other methods can attract people to live in rural areas or villages, from my perspective, the best strategy is investing in compulsory education in these areas. Apparently, the primary reason is that if governments pay much attention to essential education, children will obtain more chances to have access to advanced teaching methods and various curriculums, meaning that more parents are willing to move to the countryside with their children. For instance, a small fishing village in my country has attracted plenty of people to settle there in recent years; to be more specific, the government has spent a lot of revenue on multimedia approaches to teaching and has introduced local elements to class, leading to the fact that an increasing number of parents have moved to the village because they want their children to receive education which is completely different from that in cities. By contrast, if rural areas lack easy access to high-standard education, it may be difficult to attract people to settle in these areas. Therefore, I hold the notion that the best way to encourage more people to live in the countryside is for governments to invest in compulsory education there.
43:From my perspective, I strongly believe that factories should bear a greater responsibility in addressing environmental issues compared to individuals. While some may argue that individual actions, such as choosing eco-friendly products, can encourage businesses to prioritize environmental concerns, I maintain that businesses, with their larger resources, should be the ones exerting more effort into environmental protection. This is because factories have the financial means to effectively address environmental issues, thus contributing to a greener future on a more long-term and extensive scale. In contrast, the impact of individual efforts is comparatively limited and temporary. For example, with greater financial capabilities, a chemical factory can invest in solar panels or wind turbines to develop sustainable energy sources. This initiative would eliminate the burning of fossil fuels and reduce the emission of harmful gases. Similarly, a power plant can invest in liners to manage coal ash, thereby reducing underground water pollution caused by coal ash leakage. In conclusion, it is crucial for factories, with their greater capacity and resources, to take the lead in environmental protection. [175w]
44:Although the policies of building more charging stations and creating exclusive electric highways can make a contribution to the adoption of electric vehicles, from my perspective, the best one is that governments provide financial incentives for potential buyers. Obviously, the primary reason is that when governments offer subsidies or rebates for the purchase of electric vehicles, EVs will become more affordable for a broader range of consumers, which means that the adoption of non-gasoline vehicles can be accelerated. For instance, my country has undergone a dramatic transformation because of the implementation of a EV-related policy; to be more specific, the government provided a grant of up to $1000 for purchasing a new green vehicle, leading to the fact that a large number of citizens switched from fossil fuel-burning vehicles to electric ones. By contrast, without financial supports from governments, EVs, particularly those with longer ranges, tend to be less accessible and attractive to consumers. Therefore, I hold the notion that for the goal of conserving the environment, the best policy that governments can implement is to lower the purchase price of eco-friendly vehicles by providing various financial incentives.
45:Personally speaking, except for the wider implications on education, there are other intangible benefits for conducting educational activities amidst boundless vistas of nature. It provides an unparalleled transition of environment from the ordinary indoor setting, affording students an extraordinary opportunity to immerse themselves in a milieu that is both unique and invigorating. This transformative shift can be particularly illustrated through the example of a biology class exploring the biodiversity of a nearby forest. Instead of relying on textbooks or images, students can witness firsthand the interplay of various ecosystems, unveiling a cornucopia of diverse flora and fauna.  Through using binoculars to observe birds and other animals from a distance, their unique adaptations, behaviors, and ecological roles can be penetrated by students in a more dynamic approach. Likewise, perceiving and analyzing characteristics of diverse plant species, such as leaf shape, flower type, and height offers an exceptional opportunity to engage students in informed discussion about their specific interactions with other organisms. This experiential learning opportunity serves to ignite a greater sense of interest, enabling students to truly grasp the intricate interconnection of the natural world.
